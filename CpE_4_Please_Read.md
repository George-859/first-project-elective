# first-project-elective
project for elective class only.

* Requirements and instructions for this Subject:
1. Collaborate to the projects e.g. add commit, branch, push and pull request
2. The instructions of what you're going to do is commented inside the java class. Please read the instructions before you proceed.
3. Make/Create a folder and name it with your full name; "no spaces in between names" e.g. reneCatapang. Inside this folder are the screen shots of the processes of which you have gone through in order to finish the project. I have an example that you can view once you clone this repo. 
- FYI - you need to placed the images/files inside the folder so that the git or the local repository will detect the folder and its contents. Don't just create an empty folder coz it will not get detected by the Git. Once you type the "git status" on the GitBash it will shows that you've an untracked directory and obviously you need to add this to staging area then commit to the local repository and last push to remote repository(GitHub(first-project-elective))

4. PLEASE AVOID DUPLICATION OF WORKS!!!
